            <h2>Q: What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">The difference between localStorage and sessionStorage has to do with lifetime and scope: how long the data is saved for
            and who the data is accessible to. Session storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser whereas, Local storage
            stores data with no expiration date.</p>

            <h2>Q: What is difference between local and global scope in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">JavaScript variables have only two scopes. Global Variables − A global variable has a global scope which means it can be
            defined anywhere in your JavaScript code. Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function
            where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.</p>

            <h2>Q: What is event loop in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the
            Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such
            an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

            <h2>Q: How do I get undefined in JavaScript?</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
            Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.
            An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
